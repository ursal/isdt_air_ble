# ISDT Charger BLE Protocol

Technical documentation of the BLE protocol used by ISDT chargers (C4 Air, A8 Air, NP2 Air, LP2 Air, etc.).
Documented from BLE traffic analysis and verified against real device communication.

## Overview

The charger exposes a single BLE service (`0000af00-...`) with two GATT characteristics.
Communication follows a simple command/response pattern: the client writes a command and
the charger responds via BLE notifications on the same characteristic.

After connecting, the client performs a **bind handshake** on AF02, optionally queries
**hardware info** on AF02, then enters a continuous **polling loop** on AF01.

## BLE Service & Characteristics

**Service UUID:** `0000af00-0000-1000-8000-00805f9b34fb`

| Characteristic | UUID | Properties | Purpose |
|----------------|------|------------|---------|
| AF01 | `0000af01-0000-1000-8000-00805f9b34fb` | Notify, Write | Data polling (workstate, electric, IR, alarm tone) |
| AF02 | `0000af02-0000-1000-8000-00805f9b34fb` | Notify, Write | Bind handshake & hardware info query |

## Bind Handshake (AF02)

After connecting, the client must register itself with the charger. The UUID is generated
once per client instance (random UUID, 16 bytes).

### BindReq (0x18)

Written to AF02. Total length: 19 bytes.

```
Offset  Length  Field
──────  ──────  ─────────────
0       1       Command: 0x18
1       16      Client UUID (random, 16 bytes)
17      1       Reserved: 0x00
18      1       Status: 0x00
```

### BindResp (0x19)

Received via AF02 notification.

```
Offset  Length  Field
──────  ──────  ─────────────
0       1       Command: 0x19
1       1       Bound status (0 = OK)
```

## Hardware Info Query (AF02)

One-time query after connect to retrieve firmware version, hardware version, and serial number.

### HardwareInfoReq (0xE0)

Written to AF02. Single byte.

```
Offset  Length  Field
──────  ──────  ─────────────
0       1       Command: 0xE0
```

### HardwareInfoResp (0xE1)

Received via AF02 notification. Total length: 13 bytes.

```
Offset  Length  Field
──────  ──────  ─────────────
0       1       Command: 0xE1
1       1       HW version major
2       1       HW version minor
3       1       FW version major
4       1       FW version minor
5       8       Role tag ("CENTPERI") / Device ID
```

*Note on serial number / PN:* In all tested ISDT chargers and adapters, bytes 5..12 contain the static ASCII string `"CENTPERI"` (`0x43 0x45 0x4E 0x54 0x50 0x45 0x52 0x49`, or `0x49524550544E4543` in LE uint64). This is an internal BLE role/firmware constant rather than a unique hardware serial number or device PN (e.g. `260702100000-00000`). The integration filters out this static tag so that devices do not report a fake identical serial number.

## Response Frame Format

All AF01 notification responses from ISDT chargers share a common frame structure:

```
Byte 0: 0x31  Frame header (all charger and adapter models)
Byte 1: CMD   Command/response identifier
Byte 2+:      Command-specific payload
```

The `0x31` frame header is used by all known ISDT BLE devices (C4 Air, A8 Air, NP2 Air,
MASS2, etc.). It serves as a transport-layer framing byte. The parser does not need to
evaluate byte 0 — it is constant across all devices.

## Polling Commands (AF01)

All polling commands are written to AF01. Responses arrive as AF01 notifications.
Commands are sent one at a time with a 100ms interval.

### Command Cycle

One full cycle consists of 1 + (N × 3) commands, where N is the number of channels:
- 6-channel devices (C4 Air, etc.): 19 commands total
- 8-channel devices (A8 Air): 25 commands total

| # | Command | Channel | Description |
|---|---------|---------|-------------|
| 1 | AlarmToneReq | — | Query alarm tone on/off |
| 2–4 | WorkState, Electric, IR | 0 | Slot 1 data |
| 5–7 | WorkState, Electric, IR | 1 | Slot 2 data |
| 8–10 | WorkState, Electric, IR | 2 | Slot 3 data |
| 11–13 | WorkState, Electric, IR | 3 | Slot 4 data |
| 14–16 | WorkState, Electric, IR | 4 | Slot 5 data |
| 17–19 | WorkState, Electric, IR | 5 | Slot 6 data |
| 20–22 | WorkState, Electric, IR | 6 | Slot 7 data (A8 Air only) |
| 23–25 | WorkState, Electric, IR | 7 | Slot 8 data (A8 Air only) |

At 100ms per command, one full cycle takes approximately:
- 6-channel: 1.9 seconds
- 8-channel: 2.5 seconds

### AlarmToneReq (0x12 0x92)

Queries the current alarm tone status.

```
Write:    [0x12, 0x92]
Response: [0x31, 0x93, state]
```

`state`: 0 = off, non-zero = on.

### AlarmToneSet (0x13 0x9C)

Sets the alarm tone. Append the task type byte.

```
Write:    [0x13, 0x9C, task_type]
```

### ElectricReq (0x12 0xE4)

Queries voltages, currents, and cell voltages for a channel.

```
Write:    [0x12, 0xE4, channel]
Response: [0x31, 0xE5, channel, ...]
```

**ElectricResp (0xE5)** — two formats depending on response length:

**Long format (> 35 bytes):** 4-byte voltages, up to 16 cells.

```
Offset  Length  Field               Unit
──────  ──────  ─────────────       ────

38      1       Parallel state (optional)   0 or 1
```

**Work State values:**

| Value | State | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| 0 | idle | No activity |
| 1 | charging | Pre-charge / trickle phase |
| 2 | charging | CC (constant current) phase |
| 3 | charging | Active charging |
| 4 | charging | CV (constant voltage) / topping phase |
| 5 | error | Charging error |
| 6 | done | Fully charged |

**Battery Type values:**

| Value | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| 0 | LiHV | 4.35V Lithium High Voltage |
| 1 | LiIon | 4.20V Standard Lithium-Ion |
| 2 | LiFe | 3.65V Lithium Iron Phosphate (LiFePO4) |
| 3 | NiZn | Nickel-Zinc |
| 4 | NiMH/Cd | Nickel Metal Hydride / Cadmium |
| 5 | LiIon | 1.50V Lithium-Ion (special variant) |

### IRReq (0x13 0xFA)

Queries internal resistance per cell for a channel.

```
Write:    [0x13, 0xFA, channel]
Response: [0x31, 0xFB, channel, ...]
```

**IRResp (0xFB):**

```
Offset  Length  Field               Unit
──────  ──────  ─────────────       ────
0       1       Frame header: 0x31
1       1       Command: 0xFB
2       1       Channel (0–5)
3       N×2     IR per cell         0.1 mΩ (LE, 2 bytes each)
```

Number of cells is derived from response length:
- ≥ 20 bytes → 16 cells
- \> 15 bytes → 8 cells
- = 15 bytes → 6 cells
- else → (length − 3) / 2

Values of 0 or ≥ 10000 (1000 mΩ) are treated as invalid / no cell present.

## Device Discovery

ISDT chargers advertise with manufacturer data using company ID `0xABBA` (43962).
The device model is identified from bytes 2–5 of the manufacturer data payload:

| Bytes [2:6] | Model |
|-------------|-------|
| `01010000` | K4 |
| `01020000` | LP2 Air |
| `01030000` | C4 Air |
| `01040000` | C4 EVO |
| `01050000` | 608PD |
| `01060000` | K4 |
| `01070000` | C4 Air |
| `01080000` | Power 200 |
| `010f00a8` | A8 Air |
| `01100000` | PB70W |
| `01110000` | EDGE |
| `01120000` | PB100W |

## A8 Air Protocol Differences

The A8 Air (8-channel charger) uses an enhanced protocol with the following differences
from other ISDT chargers. The `0x31` frame header is identical to all other models (see
Response Frame Format above) — it is **not** A8-Air-specific.

### WorkState Mega-Packet

Instead of individual per-channel WorkState responses, the A8 Air sends a single
**203-byte mega-packet** (`A8WorkStateResp`) containing data for all 8 charging channels:

```
Format: [0x31, 0xE7, total_channels, channel_data × 8]
Total: 3 header bytes + 200 data bytes (8 × 25 bytes per channel)
```

Byte 2 contains `total_channels` (= 8), not a single channel ID as in the C4 Air format.
Channels are sequential 0–7.

**Per-channel format (25 bytes, from `A8WorkStateResp.java`):**

```
Offset  Length  Field               Unit
──────  ──────  ─────────────       ────
0       1       Work state          See WorkState values
1       1       Capacity %          0–100
2       4       Capacity done       mAh (LE)
6       4       Energy done         mWh (LE)
10      4       Work period         ms (LE)
14      1       Battery type        See Battery Type values
15      4       Work current        mA (LE) → ÷1000 = A
19      2       Battery voltage     mV (LE) → ÷1000 = V
21      2       Internal resistance 0.1 mΩ (LE) → ÷10 = mΩ
23      2       Error code          LE (0 = no error)
```

Note: The mega-packet includes IR and error code per channel, so separate IR queries
may be redundant for the A8 Air (the device still responds to them).

### Electric Responses

The A8 Air sends **9-byte Electric responses** (versus longer responses on other models):

```
Offset  Length  Field           Unit
──────  ──────  ───────────     ────
0       1       Frame header: 0x31
1       1       Command: 0xE5
2       1       Channel
3       2       Input voltage   mV (LE) → ÷1000 = V
5       4       Input current   mA (LE) → ÷1000 = A
```

Only one `ElectricReq` for channel 0 is needed. The device-level
input voltage/current is the same on all channels, as on the C4 Air.

### Feature Differences

| Feature | C4 Air | A8 Air |
|---------|--------|--------|
| Alarm tone | Yes | No |
| Cell voltages | Up to 16 per slot | Not available |
| IR per cell | Separate IRResp | Included in mega-packet |

## Timing

| Parameter | Value | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Post-connect settle | 1.0s | Wait after GATT connection before bind |
| Post-notification setup | 0.5s | Wait after enabling AF01 notifications |
| Command interval | 100ms | Delay between individual polling commands |
| Full cycle (6-channel) | ~1.9s | 19 commands × 100ms (C4 Air) |
| Full cycle (8-channel) | ~2.5s | 25 commands × 100ms (A8 Air) |
| Bind timeout | 3.0s | Max wait for BindResp on AF02 |
| Hardware info timeout | 3.0s | Max wait for HardwareInfoResp on AF02 |

## Known Quirks

- **Disconnect after ~2 minutes:** The charger may randomly disconnect the BLE connection.
  This appears to be a firmware behavior, not caused by the client. The integration handles
  this by automatically reconnecting.

- **Long/short ElectricResp format:** The response length varies by device model. Devices
  supporting more cells (e.g. for multi-cell LiPo packs) use the long format with 4-byte
  voltage fields and 16 cell slots. Single-cell charger modes use the short format.

- **HardwareInfoResp offset:** Some devices include the 0x31 frame header before the
  command byte (0xE1), others send 0xE1 at position 0. The parser checks both positions.

- **NiMH charging protection:** NiMH/Cd batteries use Delta-Peak detection (-△V) for
  charge termination. The charger monitors for a small voltage drop (configurable 3–12 mV)
  indicating a full battery. An optional capacity limit (1000–4000 mAh) serves as a
  secondary safety cutoff.
