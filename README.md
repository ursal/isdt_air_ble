Custom Home Assistant integration for **ISDT chargers** and the **MASS2** USB power adapter with Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) connectivity. Communicates directly with the device via a persistent BLE connection — no cloud, no app required.

Supports the **C4 Air** (6-channel charger), **A8 Air** (8-channel charger), **Air 8** (1S–8S LiPo balance charger), and **MASS2** (8-port USB adapter).

## Lovelace Card

A matching dashboard card is available: **[ISDT Charger Card](https://github.com/mtheli/isdt_air_card)** — battery-style slots with live charge timer, connection indicator, and full HA theme support.

## Supported Devices

> **Note:** This integration has been tested with the **ISDT C4 Air**, **ISDT A8 Air** (round-cell chargers), the **ISDT MASS2** (USB power adapter), and the **ISDT Air 8** (LiPo balance charger). Support for the **K2 Air** was added in v0.9.1 and is currently being validated by a community tester. Other ISDT devices with BLE support may work but are untested.

The integration auto-detects the device model from BLE manufacturer data and exposes the appropriate entities (6 slot sub-devices for C4 Air, 8 slot sub-devices for A8 Air, 1 pack sub-device with per-cell voltage sensors for Air 8, 8 USB port sub-devices for MASS2). Other ISDT devices using the same BLE protocol may also work — feedback and reports are welcome.

## Features

- **Auto-discovery** via Bluetooth — the device appears automatically in Home Assistant
- **One-time pairing** — the bind UUID is stored in the config entry, so the device recognises Home Assistant across restarts (no repeated button presses)
- **Persistent BLE connection** with automatic reconnect
- **Slot / port sub-devices** with detailed per-slot or per-port sensors (6 slots for chargers, 8 USB ports for MASS2)
- **Live charge timer** (chargers) using timestamp-based tracking — updates in real-time in the frontend
- **Hardware info** — firmware version, hardware version, serial number in the device registry
- **Configurable poll interval** (3–300 seconds) via options flow

## Installation

### HACS (recommended)

This integration is available in the **default HACS store** — just click the button below, or search HACS for "ISDT".

[![Open in HACS](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/hacs_repository.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/hacs_repository/?owner=mtheli&repository=isdt_air_ble&category=integration)

Then restart Home Assistant.

<details>
<summary>Manual installation</summary>

1. Copy the `custom_components/isdt_air_ble` folder into your Home Assistant `config/custom_components/` directory
2. Restart Home Assistant

</details>

## Setup

1. Make sure your Home Assistant has a Bluetooth adapter (built-in or USB)
2. Power on your ISDT device
3. It should be auto-discovered — check **Settings → Devices & Services → Discovered**
4. Click **Configure** and follow the pairing prompt — press any button on the device within 30 seconds to confirm pairing (the MASS2 will beep, chargers wait silently). After the first pairing, subsequent reconnects are silent.

## Configuration

After setup, you can adjust the **poll interval** via the integration options:

1. Go to **Settings → Devices & Services**
2. Find the ISDT device entry
3. Click **Configure**
4. Set the poll interval (default: 5 seconds, range: 3–300)

## BLE Protocol

The integration communicates directly via BLE — no cloud, no account required. All communication is fully local.

Both chargers and the MASS2 adapter use a single GATT service with two characteristics:

- **AF01** – Data polling via continuous command cycling (charger: workstate, electric, IR, alarm tone; MASS2: port status, settings)
- **AF02** – Bind handshake and hardware info query (once after connect, before polling)

Chargers run a 19-command cycle (1 alarm-tone + 6 channels × 3 commands) at 100 ms intervals. The MASS2 uses a single WorkStatus poll per cycle. BLE notifications for the MASS2 are reassembled across fragments to handle the default 23-byte ATT MTU correctly.

For a detailed technical description of the BLE protocol including packet formats, command reference, and timing, see [PROTOCOL.md](PROTOCOL.md).
